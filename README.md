Here's a brief outline for a short research paper snippet on the development of an online student misconduct information management system, focusing on AIFPU as a case study:

Introduction
The increasing number of students in universities has led to a rise in student misconduct cases, making it challenging for administrators to manage these incidents effectively. Traditional manual systems are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack transparency. This paper proposes the development of an online student misconduct information management system for AIFPU, aiming to streamline the reporting, investigation, and resolution of student misconduct cases.

Literature Review
Challenges of Manual Systems
1. Inefficiency: Manual systems are often slow and labor-intensive, leading to delays in resolving student misconduct cases (Kearns, 2017).
2. Lack of transparency: Paper-based systems can lead to a lack of transparency, making it difficult for students and administrators to track the progress of cases (Smith, 2020).

Benefits of Online Systems
1. Improved efficiency: Online systems can automate many tasks, reducing the administrative burden and increasing the speed of resolving cases (Johnson, 2019).
2. Enhanced transparency: Online systems provide a centralized platform for tracking cases, improving transparency and accountability (Williams, 202.
